.SH DESCRIPTION
This program simulates a command interpreter similar to Unix and GNU/Linux with basic commands.
Users inte6ract with this \fBsimple_shell\fR through a terminal emulator and executable shell scripts.
This simple_shell is not an exact imitation of the original Unix Shell and does not cover all original instructions.

A comprehensive documentation is available in the README.md file.

The prompt 'Hell_Shell>> ' will appear on the terminal. Enter commands after the prompt.
Multiple commands using ';' '&&' '||' specifiers are not supported. Execute commands by pressing 'ENTER'.

.SH FEATURES
* Displays a prompt and waits for user input ending with a new line (ENTER key).
* Prompt is displayed after executing each command.
* Entering 'exit' terminates the shell with status 0.
* 'exit [status]' terminates the shell with the input status (0 to 255).
* Pressing Ctrl+D (end of file) stops the program.
* Handles command lines with arguments and pathways.
* Does not quit on Ctrl+C (Ctrl+Z).
* Prints the current environment with 'env' command.
* Executes common shell commands (ls, grep, find, pwd, rm, cp, mv, exit, env, history, etc.) with arguments.
* Displays error message and prompt if executable is not found.
* Supports comments using '#'.
* Does NOT support wildcard characters (e.g., ls *.dat), pipes (|), logical operators (&&, ||), or command separators (;).
